# Secret-Messages

Remember when we were in school and we would want to give pieces of paper to your neighbour to talk to them?
Then you probably also remember when you got caught and you got into trouble.
What if, I told you that you could get in trouble but the teacher would have no idea what the message is, getting you into less trouble?

The good thing about this experiment is that you need a secret key to decode the text, without the key it will be very hard to be able to do this.
Let me give you an example:

Let's say, you want to say to your friend that:

```
the teachers butt smells

```

The message will (varies per key), transform into:

```
gAAAAABmuzMeoSejioPZ3-6AOmGnY7YEDa8VTEEyqSq7ptZTFGKu0_z4YY-qd2G33cjzJr7bgz8lDdXV5mAmGH5YU72DBnkdptTOI1sT3bgWFtxhz24ZjTP5-LKxnyEd-44UmEJqLspZdmoTYAF89fC59TVxzN_h5XZu0mnx6U-hDLab8QMvMRI=

```
And when using the decryptor you will get again:

```
The teachers butt smells

```

It's not 100% full proof as someone could get your secret key and decrypt it and you will get into trouble.
So be careful with the secret key, maybe dump it in your "Homework" folder.
